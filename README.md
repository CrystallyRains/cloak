# Harry Potter invisibility cloak
Hello!!
This project is developed by using Python. I was curios about how they shoot the part in the Harry Potter series when 
Harry is using the cloak, and finally found the secret and this project came into picture.
As the name suggests in this project , a piece of cloth is made invisible using various colour code variation methods.
Feel free to take a look.
Thank you!
